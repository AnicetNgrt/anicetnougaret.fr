Simple Elixir server that serves `priv/static` to `/`. Currently deployed on my own VPS using SystemD, Nginx for reverse-proxies and Certbot for https. The static site if 100% vanilla html and js, it's responsive and even has theme switching!

Maybe one day I'll put Phoenix framework and make this thing insane but I don't have time and need for now.
